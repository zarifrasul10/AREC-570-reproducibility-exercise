# AREC-570-reproducibility-exercise

Please download the repository as ZIP. The data files are located in the inputs folder. I used R to generate the report. You can either run the code from the R script, which will produce the output in R console. Or you could run the R markdown file which will generate the PDF report. I have suppressed the R code in the markdown so that the final PDF does not show R code.
