# AREC-570-reproducibility-exercise

Please download the repository as ZIP, or clone the repository in R studio. The data files are located in the inputs folder. You can either run the code from the R script, which will produce the output in R console. Or you could run the R markdown file which will generate the PDF report. I have suppressed the R code in the markdown so that the final PDF does not show R code.
